About me
</h3>

<p>I'm Sayem Hoque. I'm originally from Atlanta, and a graduate of Georgia Tech. I studied Computer Science and did research in the School of Mathematics for 3 years as an undergrad, working with numerical methods and unsupervised learning methods applied to biological images. Professionally, I've worked at a few startups, Amazon Music, and worked at Palantir Technologies from 2018 to 2020 building software for the US Federal Government. In 2020 I joined a non-profit, Hawkfish, which is helping downballot progressive candidates with their online voter outreach for the November 2020 elections in the US.

<p>
My professional interests revolve around government and healthcare technology. I'm most interested in how modern technologies can improve the institutions on which people rely.
