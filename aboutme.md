<h3>
About me
</h3>

<p> I'm Sayem Hoque and I'm originally from Atlanta, and a graduate of Georgia Tech. I studied Computer Science and did research in the School of Mathematics for a couple years working with numerical methods and unsupervised learning methods applied to biological images. Professionally, I've worked at a few startups, Amazon Music, and at Palantir in NY since 2018 building software for the US Federal Government. In 2020 during election season in the US, I started contracting as a data engineer for a non-profit to help House and Senate Democrats with their online voter outreach.

<p>
My personal interests include following Atlanta sports, staying active, exploring random places, and talking to strangers.
